Here is the latest version of my portfolio which has evolved from static HTML, to using templates, to now : `Next.js & React.js` 

### Upcomming changes
> Refactoring + Cleanup of Project Structure
> Add an Experience Section + Sticky Footer
> Add a `projects/directory` for more projects.
> Adjust `projects/index` to Showcase top projects + add view more

### High level
> The `pages/` directory includes all the routing
> Next.js makes this super easy! 
- `pages/index.js` = /
- `pages/about/index.js` = /about
- `pages/projects/index.js` = /projects
- `pages/contact/index.js` = /contact
